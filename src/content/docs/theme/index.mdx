A Retraceur theme holds the design of your website. It controls everything from colors, to fonts, to the entire layout. What you see when viewing the front-end of your site is mostly shaped by the theme.

Basically, a theme is a folder containing configuration files and sub-folders to include your templates, template parts and patterns. So that Retraceur can grab the theme details, you need to put the theme's folder within your site's `/wp-content/themes` directory.
