This **Personal Online Publication Hub** is a WordPress® **fork** I decided to build & maintain for [my use](https://imathi.eu) in reaction to the "Web" that Mr. Mullenweg has woven for 20 years and which has lately become untrustworthy.

## Everything's personal

To its core, Retraceur only kept what a **Personal Online Publication Hub** needs from WordPress®:

- The WP Link/Bookmark manager was removed.
- The WP Multisite feature was removed.
- The WP Comments & Trackbacks feature were removed.
- The legacy WP Editor code (_the one used by the Classic editor_) was removed.
- The WP Customizer was removed.
- WP Widgets were removed.
- WP Nav Menus were removed.

Using Retraceur you get a twice lighter software setting you free from the WordPress® trademark and the wp-dot-org chains:

- All links to the [wp-dot-org](https://w.org) network or distant API were removed from the source code.
- All references to the WordPress® trademark were replaced by the "WP" or "Retraceur" terms or removed.
- WordPress® logos were replaced by Retraceur ones.
- The Gravatar service was replaced by the [Libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org/) one.
- The WP Emojis fallback was replaced by using [OpenMojis](https://openmoji.org/).

## No business relationships

"Retraceur" is not a trademark, it's just a [GitHub organization name](https://github.com/retraceur)! You can use this name or the software logos (CC0 licensed) for any purpose. For now there's only one Retraceur member without any financial interests who is committed to maintaining high ethical standards, transparency, and integrity in all its contributions & actions.

If one or more people wishes to join Retraceur: a preliminary step will be to write a conflict of interests policy every member starting with the very first one will need to respect carefully.
